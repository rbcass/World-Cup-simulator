Group stage
In the group stage, each group is represented by a Group object. Teams are added to a group and the matches
 are played using the playMatch method. The standings for each group are updated using 
the updateStandings method, which takes in the winner of the match, and the two teams that played. The top 
two teams from each group will go on the knockout stage.

Knockout stage
In the knockout stage, the top two teams from each group are added to a list of teams. The teams are then 
paired up and the playMatch method is used to determine the winner of each match. The winner of each match 
is added to the next round and the loser is removed from the tournament. This process continues until there 
is only one team left, which is the winner of the tournament.

playMatch
The playMatch method is used to determine the winner of a match between two teams. It calculates the combined
 attribute score for each team by adding up the attribute scores of all the players on the team, as well as 
 the manager's attributes. The combined attribute score is used to calculate the probability that each team 
 will win the match. A random number is then generated and compared to the probability. If the random number
  is less than the probability, the team with the higher probability is declared the winner. Otherwise, the
   other team is declared the winner.
